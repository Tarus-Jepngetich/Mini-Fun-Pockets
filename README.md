# 🌈 Mini Fun Pockets  

> “Small pockets of creativity — one day at a time.”  

### 🌱 About  
Mini Fun Pockets is my personal journey to **rediscover my coding passion**, **build consistency**, and **regain my creative courage** through tiny, joyful projects.  
Each day, I challenge myself to create a small interactive feature using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — reminding myself that progress is built one pocket at a time.

This repo is a digital playground — no pressure, just curiosity, growth, and fun.
